    <h2>The Ultimate Cheese Pull: Tteokbokki</h2>
    Tteokbokki is the king of Korean street food. It’s made with chewy cylindrical rice cakes simmered in a thick, sweet, and spicy sauce. Adding a thick layer of melted mozzarella on top takes it to a whole new level of comfort.
    <h3><u>Tteokbokki Recipe</u></h3>
    <h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
    <h4>The Toppings</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>500g</b> Korean rice cakes (cylindrical type)</li>
<li><b>150g</b> Fish cakes, cut into bite-sized triangles</li>
<li><b>1/2</b> White onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li><b>1.5 cups</b> Shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
<li><b>1</b> Green onion, sliced diagonally for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Essentials</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>3 cups</b> Water (or anchovy/kelp broth for more depth)</li>
<li><b>1 tsp</b> Vegetable oil</li>
<li>Toasted sesame seeds</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Signature Sauce</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>3 tbsp</b> Gochujang (Korean red chili paste)</li>
<li><b>1 tbsp</b> Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
<li><b>2 tbsp</b> Sugar (adjust for sweetness)</li>
<li><b>1 tbsp</b> Soy sauce</li>
<li><b>1 tsp</b> Garlic, finely minced</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps :</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>Prepare the Rice Cakes:</b> If you are using refrigerated or frozen rice cakes, soak them in a bowl of room-temperature water for 15 minutes. This ensures they cook evenly and get that signature "QQ" (chewy) texture without cracking. Drain them and pat dry.</li>
<li><b>Create the Spicy Base:</b> In a wide, shallow pan or a wok, add your 3 cups of water and whisk in the Gochujang, Gochugaru, sugar, soy sauce, and minced garlic. Stir until the paste is fully dissolved and the liquid is a vibrant red.</li>
<li><b>The First Simmer:</b> Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Once bubbling, add the rice cakes and onions. Let them cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally so the rice cakes don't stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>

<li><b>Add the Texture:</b> Slide the fish cakes into the pan. Reduce the heat to medium. Continue to simmer for another 5 minutes. You will notice the sauce starting to reduce and thicken into a glossy glaze as the starch from the rice cakes releases.</li>
<li><b>The Cheese Melt:</b> Once the sauce has thickened enough to coat a spoon, turn the heat down to low. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese generously across the entire surface. Cover the pan with a lid for 2 minutes to trap the steam and melt the cheese until it's bubbly and stretchy.</li>
</ol>
<b>How to craft the bowl</b>
<ol>
<li><b>The Pour:</b> Use a wide spatula to gently slide the tteokbokki into a dark ceramic bowl. Try to keep the cheese layer on top so it doesn't get lost in the sauce.</li>
<li><b>The Contrast:</b> Sprinkle your green onions and toasted sesame seeds right in the center. The bright green against the white cheese and red sauce creates a perfect visual "pop."</li>
<li><b>Serve:</b> Serve it while the pan is still hot! The cheese will stay stretchy for about 10 minutes, which is your window for the perfect "cheese pull" photo for your site.</li>
