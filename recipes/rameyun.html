  <h2>The Ultimate Comfort Ramyun</h2>
   This isn't just basic instant noodles. It’s a rich, spicy, and deeply savory bowl that feels like a hug. It's all about the toppings and the perfectly timed eggs.
 <h3><u>Ramen Recipe</u></h3>
 <h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
 <h4>The Base</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>1 pack</b> Korean instant ramyun (like Shin Ramyun or Neoguri)</li>
<li><b>2.5 cups</b> water (or beef broth for extra richness)</li>
<li><b>150g</b> flank steak or ribeye, thinly sliced</li>
<li><b>1/2 cup</b> Kimchi, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Essentials</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>1 or 2 eggs</b> (for those jammy yolks)</li>
<li><b>2 stalks</b> green onions, thinly sliced on a diagonal</li>
<li><b>1 tsp</b> garlic, minced</li>
<li><b>1 tsp</b> vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Signature Spice</h4>
<ul>
<li>The included soup base packet</li>
<li><b>1/2 tsp</b> Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
<li><b>1 tsp</b> Soy sauce</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps :</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>The Jammy Eggs:</b> Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Gently lower the eggs in and boil for exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds. Immediately move them to an ice bath. Once cool, peel them carefully and slice in half.</li>

<li><b>Sear the Beef:</b> In your main pot, heat the oil over high heat. Add the beef strips and sear them quickly until browned. Toss in the minced garlic and kimchi, and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
<li><b>The Broth:</b> Pour in the water (or broth). Add the ramyun soup base and the extra gochugaru and soy sauce. Bring everything to a rolling boil.</li>
<li><b>The Noodles:</b> Add the noodle block. Cook for about 3–4 minutes. <b>Tip:</b> Lift the noodles into the air with tongs a few times while they cook; the contact with air makes them extra chewy!</li>
<li><b>Final Simmer:</b> Turn off the heat just before the noodles are fully soft, as they will keep cooking in the bowl.</li>
</ol>
<b>How to craft the bowl</b>
<ol>
<li><b>The Pour:</b> Pour the noodles and the spicy broth into a deep, aesthetic ceramic bowl. Make sure the beef and kimchi are visible on top.</li>
<li><b>The Arrangement:</b> Place your halved soft-boiled eggs on one side. The bright yellow yolk against the red broth looks incredible for photos.</li>
<li><b>The Garnish:</b> Pile the sliced green onions in the center. Sprinkle a few extra chili flakes or sesame seeds if you want that extra detail.</li>
<li><b>Serve:</b> Serve immediately while it's steaming hot!</li>
</ol>
